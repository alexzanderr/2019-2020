<A bunch of third-party libraries that can be used for simplity in cplusplus code>

<Some of them are inspired by python syntax and internal functionality>
        
<Util folder contains useful implementations of cpp code that is very similay with the functionality of built-ins from python>

<We got: exceptions system, 
        class list from python, 
        class range from python, 
        and built-in functions from python, such as: 
                print, type, len id, data type conversions and input>
